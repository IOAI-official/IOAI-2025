    "# Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Problem Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts** is a word-guessing game where players communicate ideas through visual icons. There are two roles: the **Clue-Giver** and the **Guesser**. A shared set of visual icons, each with a known description, is available to both players. Here are some sample icons:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Concepts Fig 1.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The Clue-Giver first selects a **secret**, which is a word or phrase, and then provides a **hint** about it by pointing to an **ordered sequence** of icons from the shared set — speaking or writing is not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the icons in the hint is meaningful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **first icon** typically represents the core idea of the secret.\n",
    "- The **subsequent icons** provide supporting context that helps clarify or elaborate on the main concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The following hint might be interpreted as *a place where a job that fights fire takes place* — in other words, a **fire station**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Concepts Fig 2.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If the icon order is reversed, it could instead suggest *a job that fights fire in a house* — pointing to a **firefighter**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Concepts Fig 3.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Icons can take on different meanings depending on their context. For example, the heart icon can appear in the following hint, which suggests *a tool used by doctors to listen to the heart* — a **stethoscope**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Concepts Fig 4.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The same heart icon might instead appear in a hint that implies *a fictional character that is both dead and alive* — pointing to a **zombie**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Concepts Fig 5.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "At Home-Stage, contestants had developed an AI program that predicts outcomes based on a sequence of hints. It's fun. However, your friend has now challenged you:  \n",
    "*\"Guessing is easy, but can you make an AI system that can give a good clue as well?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, they further challenged you to see if you can make an AI system that can provide a good clue so that another AI system can guess your keyword!\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the challenge more interesting, we now play the typical Concept game. To recall, our previous Concept game was simplified so that a clue could only consist of a single sequence of markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may provide up to **4 sequences of markers**!\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we can express complex ideas better. Considering the following that utilizes 3 sequences of markers to explain a **samurai**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Concepts Fig 6.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, there's more. To make the challenge even more interesting, the game will now include some keywords that are not typically present in a Concept game, such as \"International Olympiad.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you up to the challenge?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Concepts Fig 7.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**New AI-Powered Format:**\n",
    "We've replaced the human guesser with an **AI Guesser**. To streamline game play:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The target word (*label*) will always be selected from a predefined set (`options`).\n",
    "2. Hints must be an **ordered sequence of markers** chosen exclusively from a fixed set of **118 candidate markers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminologies**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure clarity and consistency, we are standardizing key terms across all materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **label**: The target answer (or \"secret\") to be identified.\n",
    "- **options**: The predefined candidate set from which all valid *labels* are selected.\n",
    "- **marker**: An icon representing a concept, accompanied by its text description.\n",
    "- **hints**: An **ordered sequence** of *markers* provided to the AI guesser to help identify the *label*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to provide **hints** for each *label* to help the **AI guesser** identify it. For example, when the target label is `\"microphone\"`, your program may generate four hint sequences like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Hint 1**:  \n",
    "    `[\"Object-Box\", \"Electronic-Computing\", \"Mouth-Taste\", \"Ear-Sound-Hearing\", \"Tool-Construction\"]`\n",
    "2.  **Hint 2**:  \n",
    "    `[\"Music-Song\", \"Television-Program-Show\", \"Work-Occupation\", \"Use - Action-Do - Verbe-Button\"]`\n",
    "3.  **Hint 3**:  \n",
    "    `[\"Black\", \"Metal\", \"Plastic-Rubber\", \"Cylinder\", \"Circle-Ring\"]`\n",
    "4.  **Hint 4**:  \n",
    "    `[\"Arm-Hand-Finger\", \"Happy-Positive\", \"Expression - Quote-Talking-Words\", \"Life-Heart-Love\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The above example is for illustrative purposes only. The program should generate lists of IDs but not strings; please refer to both `3. Task` and the [baseline.ipynb](https://ioai.bohrium.com/notebooks/26681337682).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the provided dataset is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "datasets/\n",
    "├── train/\n",
    "│   └── A huggingface dataset\n",
    "└── hint_descriptions/\n",

    "    │   └── A huggingface dataset\n",
    "    └── test_b/\n",
    "        └── A huggingface dataset\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training set: files in this folder are used for model training. It contains:\n",
    "   - `train/`: A huggingface dataset with a single split `'train'`, with 30 examples, each containing:\n",
    "     - `label`: string - the target keyword/answer\n",
    "     - `options`: sequence of strings - list of 100 possible choices\n",
    "   - `hint_descriptions/`: A huggingface dataset with a single split `'train'`, with 118 markers and their descriptions:\n",
    "     - `ID`: int64 - unique identifier for each marker\n",
    "     - `Description`: string - textual description of what the marker represents\n",
    "     - `image`: Image - visual representation of the marker\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test sets: Located at `os.environ.get(\"DATA_PATH\")/test/`. These will be inaccessible during development and will only be available in the evaluation environment:\n",
    "   - `test_a/`: A huggingface dataset with a single split `'test'` containing 150 examples for leaderboard A evaluation\n",
    "   - `test_b/`: A huggingface dataset with a single split `'test'` containing 150 examples for final scoring\n",
    "   Both test datasets contain the same structure as the training set (`label` and `options` fields).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to provide **hint** for each *label* to help the **AI guesser** identify it. You are required to develop a program that takes two inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A string `label` (your secret *label*)\n",
    "2. The `options` list (100 candidate choices for the guesser)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `label` is guaranteed to be one of the `options`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the program will utilize the predefined `candidate markers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Concepts Fig 8.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This program should return a list of lists of integers for each `label`, representing the hints(i.e. the sequences of markers). Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The returned list must contain **no more than 4** sequences.\n",
    "- Each sequence can contain **up to 8 integers**.\n",
    "- Each integer represents the ID of a marker in the clue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your hints will then be given to a black-box AI guesser. You will score a point if the black-box AI guesser can correctly guess your secret keyword based on your hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Submission**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit a notebook that generates `submission.zip`, which includes `clues_a.jsonl` and `clues_b.jsonl`, the clues for testset a and b, respectively, in `json` format. Refer to the baseline notebook for how to generate these files and the specific structure of the `jsonl` files. Please make sure to follow the naming and structuring conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contestants may submit model files. **If submitting model files, contestants must create a corresponding dataset on the Bohrium platform.** Only **one** dataset **can** be submitted for this task, and its size **must not** exceed 2GB. Preloaded datasets and models will be automatically mounted on the test machine, **eliminating the need for manual mounting during submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, contestants are permitted to use larger external models to assist in developing their submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your clue is evaluated using two metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hits@10\n",
    "\n",
    "= 1 if the secret word is in the top 10 guesses from the AI, else 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)  \n",
    "Rewards the correct guess more if it appears higher in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the secret word is at rank *i* (1-based):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{NDCG@10} = \\frac{1}{\\log_2(i + 1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Rank 1 → 1.00  \n",
    "- Rank 2 → ~0.63  \n",
    "- Rank 4 → ~0.43  \n",
    "- Rank 10 → ~0.29\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final score will be a combination of both, specifically, it will be 0.9 Hits@10 + 0.1 NDCG@10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring means that you'll get a significant point as long as the guesser can guess the secret keyword correctly, but more point is given if the guesser can predict the secret keyword earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Baseline & Available Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Below you can find the baseline solution.\n",
    "- The training set and pretrained models are in `training_set` folder.\n",
    "- The highest score by the Scientific Committee for this task is 0.54, this score is used for score unification.\n",
    "- The baseline score by the Scientific Committee for this task is 0.20, this score is used for score unification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI-Guesser API\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assess the AI-guesser for you to play around with. See the following code on how to access the guesser. It is recommended to implement exponential retry logic as network failures might occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "guesser_response = httpx.post(f\"{API_URL}/guess\", json={\n",
    "    \"clues\": clues,\n",
    "    \"options\": options\n",
    "    }, headers={\n",
    "        \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {SCORER_API_KEY}\"\n",
    "    }, timeout=60).json()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: The AI-Guesser API will not be available on the inference machines. In other words, do **NOT** call the api in your submission notebooks. This is only for you to validate/train your model locally. You may attach your model weights, training data, etc. via a Bohrium dataset. Refer to the Requirements section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We installed `vllm`, `sglang` and `unsloth` in environment for LLM inference and fine tuning. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Maximum submission limit: **15 times**. Only successful submissions (i.e., those receive a score on Leaderboard A) will be counted toward the submission limit.\n",
    "- Testing environment restrictions: The test machine will run your Notebook within **10 minutes**. If the execution time exceeds **10 minutes**, the system will forcibly terminate and return a feedback of “Timeout” or “Failed”.\n",
    "- Data and model submission: In this task, contestants should submit a Notebook and have the option to submit 1 attached dataset generated by themselves. The dataset must not exceed `2GB` in total size. You are warned that attaching a very large dataset might prolong the testing process, as the dataset needs to be mounted to the inference machine. While this process does not count towards the execution time limit, it will take longer for you to be able to see and select your submissions.\n",
    "- Network: For the on-site stage, the test machine cannot connect to the internet. In other words, downloading commands such as 'pip' and 'conda' or trying to call APIs will not work. Specific to this problem, the testing machines cannot access the guessor API nor the LLM proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Access Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Your token will grant you 12,500 `POST` requests to `/guess` endpoint of the AI-guesser API. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If successful, this will return a dictionary in the form `{'guesses': ['firefighter', 'fire inspector', 'fire marshal', 'fire warden', 'fire safety officer', 'smokejumper', 'pyrotechnician', 'firewatcher', 'chef', 'cook'], 'message': 'Generated 10 guesses'}`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If unsuccessful, this will either raise an `HTTPStatusError` and return `{'detail': 'error message'}`, or return `{'guesses': [], 'message': 'unable to generate guesses'}`. \n",
    "- Usually, the former is because you have exceeded the 12,500 limit of your token, or you tried to make more than 1000 requests within 1 minute, and the latter is because your clues exceeded 4 sequences or exceeded 8 markers in 1 sequence. \n",
    "- Refer to the error message for details.\n",
    "- There might be 1-2 failures in 1000 requests, 'retry' mechanism is provided in [baseline.ipynb](https://ioai.bohrium.com/notebooks/26681337682).\n",
